DIGITAL COMMONS CATALYST (DCC) License
[ NO COST ACCESS - SOURCE-AVAILABLE - NO ATTRIBUTION - SHARE ALIKE ]

Subject to the below terms, all included project files and exported media in this repository are freely 
available to be used or studied by you, in part or whole. Copy-derivative works must be distributed under this same license 
and conditions. See the "PHILOSOPHY" section at the end for the driving spirit behind these terms.


DEFINED TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
In the context of this license:

a)	Artifacts: The terms "artifact" or "artifacts" refer to included digital media, code, and/or project files 
	included under this license (Legal: this constitutes copyright works and subject matter other than works as subject matter 
	of this license);

b)	Copy-Derivative: the terms "copy-derivative" or "copy-derived" refer to any artifact created by you (the licensee) 
	containing whole or sections copied, derived, modified or adapted from artifacts subject to the terms of 
	this license. 
	These terms also refer to artifacts created using included tools (e.g. exported media file). 
	These terms do not include knowledge gained from the study of those artifacts, then applied in an otherwise original
	work, invention or other intellectual property asset. Such knowledge gained is free/exempt from this license.

c)	No Cost Access: the terms "No Cost", "No Cost Access", and "No Financial Cost" do not include the cost of access to 
	a computer and unrestricted internet.


LICENSE
You may study, use, adapt and/or modify what you find in the artifacts for use in your own copy-derivative works, 
subject to the following license terms:

1) 	NO COST ACCESS: Where publishing a copy-derivative product, any such copy-derivatives must be accompanied by a 
	publicly accessible access option, permitted to be studied, used, adapted and/or modified by the public at no 
	financial cost, including being free from mandatory account creation or pay walls. 
	(Legal: this public access constitutes access on an anonymous basis).

2) 	SOURCE-AVAILABLE: Project/source files generated by you in the process of creating (and directly relevant to) 
	copy-derivates must also be included in any release of the copy-derivatives (where the redistribution of 
	such files do not infringe on the law or other license(s)).
	These project/source files are to be included so that licensees may effectively utilise their rights in the 
	copy-derivatives as granted under the terms of this license.

3) 	NO ATTRIBUTION: No credit/attribution is required to be given to any original copyright-holders (e.g. original author)
	for copy-derivative works. 
	To the extent required under applicable laws to give effect to this clause 3, you (the licensee) waive your moral rights 
	subsisting in any such copy-derivative work, and warrant that sufficient waivers have been provided from all other relevant 
	authors in the associated copy-derivative work.

4) 	SHARE ALIKE: You may publish or distribute your own works copy-derived from the included artifacts, on the condition that 
	the entirety of the copy-derivative works are distributed under this same license. A copy of the terms of this 
	license must be included, accessible and clearly marked in your copy-derivative work.

5) 	Author Liability Protection: The artifacts are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, 
	including, but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. 
	In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an 
	action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the artifacts or the use or other
	dealings in the artifacts.


CLARIFICATIONS
i) "No Cost Access" does not mean non-commercial. Copy-derivative works may be used within a commercial platform, 
or made available on a commercial basis in conjunction with the no cost access distribution method. However, at 
all times that the licensee makes the copy-derivative work available on a commercial (paid) basis, there must be an 
accompanying, no-financial-cost option to accessing ALL included artifacts for the general public (and not 
requiring a user account for access). Any distribution, publication, dissemination or communication to the public 
of a paid and/or account version of a copy-derivative work must also include these license terms to make it clear 
that a no-cost option is available.

	Example 1: a copy-derivative product may be published to video or audio streaming website even if that 
		streaming website has an option for a paid subscription, ONLY IF the general public also is presented with 
		an option to, AT NO FINANCIAL COST, access and use the copy-derivative product and artifacts under
		this same license. If the website requires an account to access the product, it is not compatible with 
		this license.

	Example 2: a copy-derivative product may be distributed through a "pay-what-you-want" model, given that 
		the minimum price is free / no-cost, and access is given to all included project files and artifacts. 

	Example 3: The artifacts under this license may be used in a marketing campaign for a commercial product, 
		ONLY IF the general public is presented with an option to, AT NO FINANCIAL COST, access and use the 
		copy-derivative marketing product and artifacts under this same license.

	Example 4: a copy-derivative product may be used as part of a live performance with paid tickets, however it
		must be made clear before purchase of paid ticket that all associated digital artifacts are also available 
		and usable AT NO FINANCIAL COST, and covered by this same license (and by providing access to these 
		artifacts).

ii) The term "copy-derivative" is used rather than "derivative" to emphasise that the study and application of 
knowledge gained from included artifacts is not restricted by this license. Directly copied code or artifacts, 
however, are restricted by the license.

	Example 1: A person who learns about the general structure of an algorithm from a project or source code 
		file under this license can then implement that same general algorithm in their own project - commercial or not. 
		However, if that person copies code or files directly from artifacts included under this license, they 
		must use this same license when redistributing. 

	Example 2: Algorithms, techniques or other patterns in included artifacts can be used in an educational 
		environment. Students can then use these same patterns in their own works, under any other license. If those students 
		copy code or artifacts directly from included artifacts, they must use this same license when redistributing.

	Example 3: A musical score included as an artifact can be studied and analysed. A new musical score created, 
		inspired by the included score, does not have to be licensed under this license. However, if large sections of the 
		original score are copied and "quoted" or if recorded audio samples of the original piece are used in producing the 
		new work, this new work will need to be licensed under this same license.

	Example 4: If a person uses an included tool to generate a new creative work, that resultant creative work 
		(and associated project files), if distributed, will need to be distributed under this same license.
		
iii) Source-available in the context of this license means to include all relevant project/source files, where legally possible.

	Example 1: If a person creates a copy-derivative of a work, that copy-derivative release needs to be accompanied 
		by any project/source files they generated and used to generate their final product.
		If they used a hardware tool or software program where it is either not possible to retrieve the project/source files,
		or the redistribution of project/source files is legally prohibited, they do not need to include them in the release.
		The aim of this clause is to make the creation process of final products as transparent as possible for study
		and re-use.
		

PHILOSOPHY
[Please note that this section, titled “PHILOSOPHY”, does not constitute legally binding terms or restrictions of 
the license above, but further explanation to the “spirit” of this license. It must, however, be included and 
unaltered as part of the license in copy-derivative distributions.]

No matter how many people - individuals, small groups, or culture-wide movements - adopt and pass this license on, 
the general public benefits from a growing pool of culture, tools, and resources to access and study at no financial cost. 
This empowers people, no matter their socioeconomic situation. The conditions placed by this license for copy-derivatives 
are designed as a mechanism and a catalyst to grow and spread this freely available pool of resources. 
The 4 pillars of this Digital Commons Catalyst mechanism are:

	NO COST ACCESS: This license was created in the spirit of increasing the pool of culture, tools and resources 
		in the digital public commons. No Cost Access is a key point of difference from many other open source or 
		source-available licenses designed to prevent socioeconomic barriers and make these commons available to all.

	SOURCE-AVAILABLE: If the design mechanics behind all technologies and cultural creations were transparent 
		and commonly shareable, learning and innovation would accelerate at an incredible rate. While this is an ideal, 
		following and sharing this license contributes directly to making this reality. 

	NO ATTRIBUTION: One key difference to other commons-oriented licenses is the lack of requirement for 
		attribution to any original authors. Our world is built on the work of countless others before us,
		whether history remembers them or not. All too often, popular narratives place all the credit in 
		the hands of very few, distorting the reality of communal involvement in progress. Realistically, we cannot
		list all those who contributed to an idea or work. It is better that we acknowledge this reality and put more 
		emphasis on the progress of the work itself, rather than on the person. Additionally, this will let the 
		artifact be judged and used on its own merit, rather than a perception of who it came from. 
		This "non-restriction" is made explicit to counter the assumption of attribution required.

	SHARE ALIKE: The Share Alike clause, requiring usage of this same license, is used to prevent copy-derivative
 		products from simply taking these artifacts and putting a price on them, which would subvert the mission of 
		this license.
